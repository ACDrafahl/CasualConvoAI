#To-Do
- Somehow interupt the push-to-talk if the spacebar is released, stopping the listening process. This might be possible through threads. 
- Find a way to hide all the gobbledy gook that's currently being printed to the console so that the user only sees clean output.
- Adjust length of GPT responses in a way that doesn't cut it off in the middle of a sentence.
- Look at GPT4All documentation to see how you can adjust behaviors based on user input
- Use GPT4All documentation to figure out why GPT is trying to get online when running the program, and stop it. 
- Change logo to something like the blue guy from Disney Universe crossed with the tv bot from NintendoLand crossed with ShuffleBot from DougDoug

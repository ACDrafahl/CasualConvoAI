#To-Do
##By Ease of Implementation:
1. Change logo to something like the blue guy from Disney Universe crossed with the tv bot from NintendoLand crossed with ShuffleBot from DougDoug.
2. Find a way to hide all the gobbledy gook that's currently being printed to the console so that the user only sees clean output.
3. Somehow interupt the push-to-talk if the spacebar is released, stopping the listening process. This might be possible through threads.
4. To expand on interrupting the listening, find a way to also cut off the speech of the bot when the space bar is pressed.
5. Actually implement a UI
6. Adjust length of GPT responses in a way that doesn't cut it off in the middle of a sentence.
7. Use GPT4All documentation to figure out why GPT is trying to get online when running the program, and stop it.
8. Fix the speech bug where having too much output results in the same audio file being played again instead of overwritten.
9. Look at GPT4All documentation to see how you can adjust behaviors based on user input
